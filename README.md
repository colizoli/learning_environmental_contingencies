All analyses are run from "analysis/run_analysis_prediction.py".
You can isolate the preprocessing, trial-level, and higher-level analyses individually by setting the levels on/off.
To run the higher-level functions alone, the processed datafile is given for convenience "derivatives/data_frames/task-prediction_subjects.csv".
